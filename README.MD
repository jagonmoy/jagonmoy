Im a Software Engineer with 2.5+ years of experience  and passionate about building scalable systems that solve real-world challenges. With experience developing complex, multi-tenant platforms, I enjoy crafting reliable, high-performance applications across the full stack. I have a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures, and I'm equally drawn to researchâ€”especially in Natural Language Processing and the use of large language models to improve software development workflows, automation, and user experience.
