I'm passionate about leveraging technology to address real-world challenges. As a Full Stack Software Engineer, I specialize in using NextJs for front-end development and NestJs for the back-end. My expertise extends to solving complex problems with data structures and algorithms, and I have experience working with Natural Language Processing.
<br> <br>

- **Frontend Development**

    - Utilized NextJs for enhanced performance, leveraging Server Side Rendering, Static Site Generation, client side rendering etc.

    - Designed responsive UIs with Tailwind CSS and created reusable React components to minimize code duplication.

    - Optimized image handling using next/image and Imgix for improved performance and efficiency.

    - Implemented custom fields integration for a multi-tenant system.

- **Backend Development**

    - Improved system efficiency by optimizing backend APIs and SQL queries.

    - Worked with event queue architecture to facilitate automated email functions for both scheduled and event-driven tasks, supporting over 50,000 users.

    - Used MJML for designing responsive and visually appealing email templates.

- **Authentication**

    - Integrated the application with an OIDC-based authentication system using NextAuth.

- **Testing**

    - Employed Playwright for end-to-end testing and Jest for unit testing to ensure the application's robustness and reliability.

- **Data Structures and Algorithms** 

    - Solved 1200+ data structure and algorithms problems, achieving a Codeforces rating of 1500+. 

- **Machine Learning**

    - Contributed to the field of Natural Language Processing during my undergraduate thesis titled **Speaker diarization with speech recognition in Bangla**.
